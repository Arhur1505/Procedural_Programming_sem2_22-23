# Procedural Programming

This repository contains materials and tasks related to the course "Procedural Programming" course offered in the third semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.
## Course Overview

Throughout this course, students will cover the following topics:

1. **Expressions and Statements**:
   - Program structure, data types, constants.
   - Local and global variables, variable initialization.
   - Code blocks, variable scope.
   - Type qualifiers and specifiers, operators.
   - Conditional, iterative, and jump statements.

2. **Functions, Pointers, Arrays, and Strings**:
   - Function definition, passing parameters, return values.
   - Functions with variable-length parameter lists, recursive functions.
   - Declaration and initialization of arrays and pointers.
   - Address-of and dereference operators, pointer arithmetic.
   - Character arrays and string operations.
   - Function pointers, command-line arguments.

3. **Structures, Unions, Bit Fields, and Enumerations**:
   - Declaring and initializing structures, unions, bit fields, and enumerations.
   - Accessing structure and union members, passing structures to functions.
   - Pointers to structures.

4. **Preprocessor Directives**:
   - Preprocessor directives, macros with parameters, conditional compilation.

5. **Abstract Data Types in C**:
   - Implementing simple interfaces for abstract data types like linked lists and trees.

6. **Standard Library**:
   - Mathematical functions, input/output functions, dynamic memory allocation functions.
   - Using library functions such as `qsort` and `bsearch`, passing functions as pointers.

7. **C Language Standards**:
   - Understanding C89, C99, and C11 standards.
   - Practical use of features introduced in C99 and C11.

8. **Software Engineering Elements**:
   - Compilation, linking, make and makefile, static and dynamic libraries.
