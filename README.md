# Procedural Programming
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Procedural Programming** course, offered in the second semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course focuses on fundamental principles of procedural programming using **C**, covering:

- Program structure, data types, variables, and memory management.
- Operators, control flow structures, and function definitions.
- Arrays, pointers, and string manipulation.
- Structs, unions, bit fields, and enumerations.
- Preprocessor directives and macro definitions.
- Abstract data types, including linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- Standard C libraries for mathematical and input/output operations.
- Compilation, linking, and makefile automation.

Laboratory exercises were conducted using **C**, emphasizing structured programming, efficient memory usage, and problem-solving techniques.

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to build a strong foundation in **C programming** and procedural software development.
